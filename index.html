      <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Zsombor Bálint Hajzer and I am a first year student at NHL Stenden in the Information Technology Course. I am Hungarian by birth but I have lived in Stuttgart, Germany and Nottingham, England for smaller parts of my life. I have finished my IB diploma at the International School of Stuttgart, and have attended the first year of Electrical Engineering course at the University of Nottingham. Once I reaised that that Study choice was not right for me, I have moved to Emmen, Netherlands in the hopes of getting a degree in Information Technology.

    <h3>Reflection Report</h3>

<!--  possible consequences this first
semester may have on the upcoming
second semester     xxxxxxx


 an elaboration on whether you feel you
made the right study choice  xxxxxx


 an evaluation of your study progress so
far xxxxxxx


 a statement whether you will continue
with your studies xxxxxx



 finally, this statement should be
supported with rational arguments -->

    <p>Some consequences that my first period preformace will have is that it will slightly be harder since I did not pass the Web-Developement exam. I have managed to get 5.2 which was close to passing but was not enough. I feel like I have underestimated the Web-Developement exam and I did not practice enough. Because of this now I will have two exams one week apart which will make my life a lot more dificult. 
    But in order to prevent my self from doing extra work I will try to pass every exam on the first try from now on. </p>

    <p>I feel like I have made the right study choice since all though the first two semester we did not learn the things I came here for, it was still very interesting. I belive that personally for me this course will only get more interesting, the more techincal it gets. I enjoy understanding the how the world works around us and therefore I am looking forward to the Java classes in programming.</p>

    <p>So far my study progress has been alright in my oppinion. I have passed the information mangement exam on the first try in the first semester and I have passed the first project with a 7.5. On the other hand I have sadly failed the Web-Developement exam. Other than exams I feel like I am usually up to date with most of the work in school. I find it usefull to have lessons where the teachers time is dedicated to you and to help you. I sometimes find it difficult to work in groups for the project since a lot of people are behind with study material and for that reason it is hard to progress forward. </p>

    <p>I will continue with my study programming</p>

    <p>This is becuase I enjoy the study programm, the teachors are nice and helpful and I belive the study programm will only get more interesting from here on out.</p>
