      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Zsombor Bálint Hajzer and I am a first year student at NHL Stenden in the Information Technology Course. I am Hungarian by birth but I have lived in Stuttgart, Germany and Nottingham, England for smaller parts of my life. I have finished my IB diploma at the International School of Stuttgart with higher level subjects such as Math and Physics, and have attended the first year of Electrical Engineering course at the University of Nottingham. Once I realised that that Study choice was not right for me, I have moved to Emmen, Netherlands in the hopes of getting a degree in Information Technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection Report</h2>

    <p>Some consequences that my first period preformace will have is that it will slightly be harder since I did not pass the Web-Developement exam. I have managed to get 5.2 which was close to passing but was not enough. I feel like I have underestimated the Web-Developement exam and I did not practice enough. Because of this now I will have two exams one week apart which will make my life a lot more dificult. 
    But in order to prevent my self from doing extra work I will try to pass every exam on the first try from now on. </p>

    <p>I feel like I have made the right study choice since all though the first two semester we did not learn the things I came here for, it was still very interesting. I belive that personally for me this course will only get more interesting, the more techincal it gets. I enjoy understanding the how the world works around us and therefore I am looking forward to the Java classes in programming.</p>

    <p>So far my study progress has been alright in my opinion. I have passed the information mangement exam on the first try in the first semester and I have passed the first project with a 7.5. On the other hand I have sadly failed the Web-Developement exam. Other than exams I feel like I am usually up to date with most of the work in school. I find it usefull to have lessons where the teachers time is dedicated to you and to help you. I sometimes find it difficult to work in groups for the project since a lot of people are behind with study material and for that reason it is hard to progress forward. This has caused a few conflicts where people did not like my attitude towards their work ethic but luckly this was cleared up on every occasion with a mutual understanding to eachother.</p>

    <p><b>I will continue with my study programming</b></p>

    <p>This is becuase I enjoy the study programm, the teachors are nice and helpful, I belive the study programm will only get more interesting from here on out and I have always had an interes in programming. So far I still have a lot of interest in the study program and therefore I have a lot of motivation to continue my study programm. I feel like the study program will get more and more dificult from here on out so I need to organize myself a little bit better so that I have time for my self, and for my studies equally. I am the most interested in java and OOP programing which is in the upcoming semester. This will be very difficult according to the teachers since this way of thinking is not natural to humans, but I can not wait to tackle this problem. </p>
